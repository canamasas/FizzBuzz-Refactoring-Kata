FizzBuzz Refactoring Kata
=========================

Refactor this code so that adding the new feature is very easy. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change".

New feature
-----------

In addition to Multiples of 3 being "Fizz" and multiples of 5 being "Buzz":

* Multiples of 7 are “Whizz”
* Multiples of 11 are “Bang”

That means for example that multiples of 3 & 7 are “FizzWhizz”, multiples of 5 & 11 are “BuzzBang” etc. 

* The program should continue to print out numbers beyond 100 and instead stop the first time you get “FizzBuzzWhizzBang”.
